		<h2>Step 1: Reflection</h2>

		<p>Exisiting websites that most inspired my designs are mostly blogs. A few that are at top of my mind are <a href="http://www.notcot.com/">Notcot</a> and <a href="http://summertomato.com/">Summer Tomato</a>.</p>

		<p>I'm just really proud that I was able to create a website! I like the colors I chose and how simple and clean it looks. I also like that it is responsive!</p>

		<p>I really enjoyed creating wireframes. I had so many ideas, I found myself struggling with sticking to one design.
		</p>

		<p>It was fun turning my design into a webpage. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to create what I had laid out originally in my wireframe. I had fun with the challenge though. :)</p>

		<p>I learned that there were a lot of possibilities for design for different formats. I had never really given a website's responsiveness a thought. I liked that we got the chance to make our projects responsive.</p>

	<h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>

		<p>I love the clean look to this website and the flow to the site. The layout is simple and clean. The images are carefully chosen to help with the site's branding. I would love to build something like this one day. Navigation is easy and overall flow is great!

		<p>The moment the page appeared on my screen my eyes were drawn to several moving objects on the screen. As a person trying to view the site, I was quickly annoyed at the gifs. The layout was all over the place and I found my eyes darting all over the page with anxiety. I would say that the overall flow of the website is poor. I found the site hard to navigate and the content hard to read, as the font size was too small.</p>
